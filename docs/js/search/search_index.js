It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)  WEB SOCKETS NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports WebSockets)\" to indicate that they can invoked via the Web Sockets protocol. This support is activated by invoking the end-point using the ws:// protocol in the URL.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)  WEB SOCKETS NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports WebSockets)\" to indicate that they can invoked via the Web Sockets protocol. This support is activated by invoking the end-point using the ws:// protocol in the URL.  Any request query parameters can still be sent on the URL and the request body can be sent as one or more message from the client (as documented).  The end-point response will be sent as one or more response messages as documented (sometimes describing progress as with SSE end-points).  Upon failure responses will follow the same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.7.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                            body\n                                        \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        body\n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        body:     Blob\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :     Blob\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        export interface BulkdataLoadBody { \n    body?: Blob;\n}\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"interfaces/BulkdataRecordsBody.html":{"url":"interfaces/BulkdataRecordsBody.html","title":"interface - BulkdataRecordsBody","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Interfaces\n  \n  BulkdataRecordsBody\n\n\n\n        \n            Info\n        \n        \n            Source\n        \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            File\n        \n        \n            projects/rest-api-client-ng/src/lib/model/bulkdataRecordsBody.ts\n        \n\n\n            \n                Description\n            \n            \n                Senzing POC REST API\nThis is the Senzing POC REST API.

Advanced attribute types usually require the user to have some knowledge of how the data is mapped in the entity repository (e.g.: \"RECORD_ID\" or \"DATA_SOURCE\").

package now requires @angular@~13.0.0 to compile and run. There are no components in this package so technically it would probably be compatible with earlier releases but it is not recommended and would not be officially supported.\nUpdating to angular 13 resolves major dependency compatibility issues so we can apply the latest security patches to the library.\nFor information updating your project from a previous angular version to ~13.0.0 see the Angular Update Guide \nrelevant tickets #78\n[2.3.0] - 2021-7-31\n\ndeleted:    \n\nszBaseResponseLinks.ts\nszBaseResponseMeta.ts\n(DEPRECATED) szBulkDataLoadResponse.ts\nbody.ts\nbody1.ts\nbody2.ts\nbody3.ts\nbody4.ts\nbody5.ts\n\n\nadded:\n\nbulkdataAnalyzeBody.ts\nbulkdataLoadBody.ts\nbulkdataRecordsBody.ts\ndatasourcesBody.ts\ndatasourcesBody1.ts\nentitytypesBody.ts\nentitytypesBody1.ts\nszDeleteRecordResponseData.ts\nszDisclosedRelation.ts\nszLinks.ts (replaces szBaseResponseLinks)\nszMeta.ts (replaces szBaseResponseMeta)\nszOpenApiSpecResponse.ts\nszOpenApiSpecResponseOrRawJson.ts\nszQueueInfo.ts\nszQueueInfoResponse.ts\nszRelatedFeatures.ts\nszRelationDirection.ts\nszWhyEntitiesResponse.ts\nszWhyEntitiesResponseData.ts\nszWhyEntitiesResult.ts\n\n\nSenzingBaseResponse:\n\n\n- `meta` changed from type `SzBaseResponseMeta` to `SzMeta`\n- `links` changed from type `SzBaseResponseLinks` to `SzLinks`\nSzEntityRecord:\nadded lastSeenTimestamp as Date\nadded originalSourceData as { [key: string]: any; }\n\n\nSzMatchInfo\nadded disclosedRelations as Array\n\n\nSzResolvedEntity\nadded lastSeenTimestamp as Date\n\n\nSzServerInfo\nadded webSocketsMessageMaxSize as number\nadded infoQueueConfigured as boolean\nadded loadQueueConfigured as boolean\n\n\nSzVersionInfo\nadded nativeApiBuildVersion as string\nadded pocServerVersion as string\nadded pocApiVersion as string\n\n\nAdminService\nadded openApiSpecification method\nadded root method\n\n\nBulkDataService\nparameters maxFailures, and eofSendTimeout added to method analyzeBulkRecords\nparameters maxFailures, and eofSendTimeout added to method loadBulkRecords\nadded analyzeBulkRecordsForm method\nadded loadBulkRecordsForm method\n\n\nEntityDataService\nadded searchEntitiesByGet method. existing behavior or passing search parameters in the url of api requests.\nadded searchEntitiesByPost method to allow not passing search parameters through url requests.\nsearchByAttributes refactored as alias of searchEntitiesByGet to prevent breaking change.\n\n\n\n[2.2.2] - 2021-06-09\n\nDependency security updates and bugfixes. #67\nAdded new additionalHeaders parameter to ALL service methods. see issue #63\nNew methods and property added to Cofiguration class :\nadditionalHeaders\naddAdditionalRequestHeader\nremoveAdditionalRequestHeader\n\n\n\nrelevant tickets: #63, #67\n[2.2.1] - 2021-04-08\n\nDependency security updates and bugfixes.\n\n[2.2.0] - 2020-10-16\nthe models need to be updated to match the 2.2.0 specification release.\nhttps://github.com/Senzing/senzing-rest-api-specification/releases/tag/2.2.0\n\nAdded SzNameScoring to describe name scoring details\nAdded SzSearchFeatureScore for search feature scores\nModified SzBaseRelatedEntity to remove fullNameScore field since it has\nnot been populated since switch to version 2.0.0 of native Senzing SDK and\nnever made sense in the \"base class\" since only SzAttributeSearchResult had\nthis field populated under native Senzing SDK version 1.x.\nAdded bestNameScore field to SzAttributeSearchResult to replace\nfullNameScore in the place where the name score was previously\nused with version 1.x of the native Senzing SDK (i.e.: to sort search results\nbased on the strength of the name match).\nModified SzAttributeSearchResult to include the featureScores field to\nprovide feature scores without using \"raw data\"\nAdded nameScoringDetails field to SzFeatureScore class to provide\nSzNameScoring name scoring details on why operations,\nUpdated com.senzing.api.model.SzFeatureScore to define its score field as \nthe most sensible score value from the nameScoringDetails for \"NAME\"\nfeatures since the FULL_SCORE field is not available for names.\nAdded the NOT_SCORED value for SzScoringBucket enum.\n\n[2.1.0] - 2020-9-20\nMaintenance release for framework upgrade to Angular 10: see https://blog.angular.io/version-10-of-angular-now-available-78960babd41\nMajor updates to most dependency versions have also been made which should improve file sizes, security, and stability.\nThe following Senzing projects have also been updated to operate on Angular 10,\nsee the following links for associated tickets:\n\nsdk-components-ng/issues/143\nrest-api-client-ng/issues/39\nsdk-graph-components/issues/37\n\n2.0.1 - 2020-9-20\nMinor updates to dependency versions.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)  WEB SOCKETS NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports WebSockets)\" to indicate that they can invoked via the Web Sockets protocol. This support is activated by invoking the end-point using the ws:// protocol in the URL.  Any request query parameters can still be sent on the URL and the request body can be sent as one or more message from the client (as documented).  The end-point response will be sent as one or more response messages as documented (sometimes describing progress as with SSE end-points).  Upon failure responses will follow the same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)\nOpenAPI spec version: 2.7.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                        \"ADDRESS\" | \"CHARACTERISTIC\" | \"IDENTIFIER\" | \"NAME\" | \"OBSERVATION\" | \"PHONE\" | \"RELATIONSHIP\" | \"OTHER\"\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n    projects/rest-api-client-ng/src/lib/model/szAttributeNecessity.ts\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    SzAttributeNecessity\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Senzing REST API\nThis is the Senzing REST API.
