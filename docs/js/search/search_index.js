It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)  WEB SOCKETS NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports WebSockets)\" to indicate that they can invoked via the Web Sockets protocol. This support is activated by invoking the end-point using the ws:// protocol in the URL.  Any request query parameters can still be sent on the URL and the request body can be sent as one or more message from the client (as documented).  The end-point response will be sent as one or more response messages as documented (sometimes describing progress as with SSE end-points).  Upon failure responses will follow the same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)\nOpenAPI spec version: 3.5.2\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n            \n\n\n        \n            Index\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Properties\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                            body\n                                        \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n            \n                Properties\n                    \n                        \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        body\n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        body:     Blob\n\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Type :     Blob\n\n                                        \n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Optional\n                                        \n                                    \n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n            \n    \n\n\n    \n        export interface BulkdataAnalyzeBody { \n    body?: Blob;\n}\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"interfaces/BulkdataLoadBody.html":{"url":"interfaces/BulkdataLoadBody.html","title":"interface - BulkdataLoadBody","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Interfaces\n  \n  BulkdataLoadBody\n\n\n\n        \n            Info\n        \n        \n            Source\n        \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            File\n        \n        \n            projects/rest-api-client-ng/src/lib/model/bulkdataLoadBody.ts\n        \n\n\n            \n                Description\n            \n            \n                Senzing REST API\nThis is the Senzing REST API.

This API is NOT maintained for backwards compatibility.  This API extends the Senzing REST API which is maintained for backwards compatibility.  However, the Senzing POC API is specifically targeted at the Senzing One-Day POC application and no guarantees are made for support.  It can be used as example for creating your own extended API.  SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)  WEB SOCKETS NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports WebSockets)\" to indicate that they can invoked via the Web Sockets protocol. This support is activated by invoking the end-point using the ws:// protocol in the URL.  Any request query parameters can still be sent on the URL and the request body can be sent as one or more message from the client (as documented).  The end-point response will be sent as one or more response messages as documented (sometimes describing progress as with SSE end-points).  Upon failure responses will follow the same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)\nOpenAPI spec version: 3.5.2\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code

Advanced attribute types usually require the user to have some knowledge of how the data is mapped in the entity repository (e.g.: \"RECORD_ID\" or \"DATA_SOURCE\").

There are no components in this package so technically it would probably be compatible with earlier releases but it is not recommended and would not be officially supported.\nUpdating to angular 15 resolves major dependency compatibility issues so we can apply the latest security patches to the library.\nFor information updating your project from a previous angular version to ~15.0.0 see the Angular Update Guide \nmodels updated to senzing-rest-api-spec@3.3.0\n\nAdded methods and models to support \"how entity\" functionality\nAdded enumeration options for detail levels and feature mode to allow for graph optimization.\n\nAdded\n\nSzFeatureReference model\nSzHowEntityResponse model\nSzHowEntityResult model\nSzHowMatchInfo model\nSzRecordIdentifier model\nSzRecordIdentifiers model\nSzResolutionStep model\nSzVirtualEntity model\nSzVirtualEntityData model\nSzVirtualEntityRecord model\nSzVirtualEntityResponse model\nBAREMINIMAL added to SzDetailLevel to handle just returning the\nentity ID's without record information or relationship match info.\nNETWORKMINIMAL added to SzDetailLevel to behave the same as \nSzDetailLevel.BAREMINIMAL, but with the addition of relationship match info in the case of related entities being included.\nENTITYNAMEONLY added to SzFeatureMode to handle just retrieving the entity name without actually returning other features.\nATTRIBUTED value for SzFeatureMode for pulling back feature references at the record level to indicate which records contributed which features.\nfeatureReferences property to SzEntityRecord\nthe following methods added to EntityDataService\ngetVirtualEntityByRecordIds gets a virtual entity by simulating the resolution of the records identified by the specified record ID parameters. This operation simulates the resolution of the one or more specified records into a single entity and returns the simulated \"virtual\" entity.  The subject records are identified by data source code and record ID pairs.\nhowEntityByEntityID gets an analysis of how the entity for the respective entity ID resolved. This operation provides an anlysis of how the records in an entity resolved.  The subject entity is identified by the entity ID in the request path. \nhowEntityByRecordID gets an analysis of how the entity for the record with the respective data source code and record ID resolved. This operation provides an anlysis of how the records in an entity resolved.  The subject entity is the one containing the record identified by the data source code and record ID in the request path.\n\n\n\nModified\n\nSzMatchInfo renamed to SzWhyMatchInfo\nUpdated GET /entity-paths parameter(s)\n\nRemoved\n[5.0.0] - 2022-08-11\nA new parameter and enum has been added for finer control over the detail levels of entity response objects.  \nAdded\n\nSzDetailLevel is a new enum that describes the level of detail desired for entity data when obtained via the various endpoints that return entity data. Details for features of entities as well as the related entities of entities are controlled by other flags.  Possible values are:\nMINIMAL The entities returned will include at most their entity ID's as well as identifiers for their constituent records (i.e.: data source code and record ID for each record).  This detail level is optimized for the fastest possible processing time.   \nBRIEF Builds upon MINIMAL to add the entity name and related entity match info when related entity match info when related entities are included.  This detail level aims to maintain as much speed as possible while providing names and relationship information for rendering a graph.   \nSUMMARY Identical to BRIEF except that individual record identifier information is excluded, leaving only the record summary (i.e.: a record count by data source code).  This reduces the size of the JSON document for large entities with thousands of records.  It may take longer to process than BRIEF but less data is returned as well, speeding up network transfer times.\nVERBOSE Combines BRIEF and SUMMARY and then adds the original JSON data for each record, the record-level matching info, as well as formatted record data.  NOTE: the record-level matching info returned via \"how\" and \"why\" is often more useful than that embedded in the entity.  Further, the formatted record data, while readable, is not formatted according to locale (i.e.: address, name and date formatting may not appear as expected to a user).\n\n\n\nModified\n\nThe call

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)  WEB SOCKETS NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports WebSockets)\" to indicate that they can invoked via the Web Sockets protocol. This support is activated by invoking the end-point using the ws:// protocol in the URL.  Any request query parameters can still be sent on the URL and the request body can be sent as one or more message from the client (as documented).  The end-point response will be sent as one or more response messages as documented (sometimes describing progress as with SSE end-points).  Upon failure responses will follow the same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)\nOpenAPI spec version: 3.5.2\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                        \"ADDRESS\" | \"CHARACTERISTIC\" | \"IDENTIFIER\" | \"NAME\" | \"OBSERVATION\" | \"PHONE\" | \"RELATIONSHIP\" | \"OTHER\"\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n    projects/rest-api-client-ng/src/lib/model/szAttributeNecessity.ts\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    SzAttributeNecessity\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Senzing REST API\nThis is the Senzing REST API.

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)  WEB SOCKETS NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports WebSockets)\" to indicate that they can invoked via the Web Sockets protocol. This support is activated by invoking the end-point using the ws:// protocol in the URL.  Any request query parameters can still be sent on the URL and the request body can be sent as one or more message from the client (as documented).  The end-point response will be sent as one or more response messages as documented (sometimes describing progress as with SSE end-points).

This API is NOT maintained for backwards compatibility.  This API extends the Senzing REST API which is maintained for backwards compatibility.  However, the Senzing POC API is specifically targeted at the Senzing One-Day POC application and no guarantees are made for support.  It can be used as example for creating your own extended API.
