It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)  WEB SOCKETS NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports WebSockets)\" to indicate that they can invoked via the Web Sockets protocol. This support is activated by invoking the end-point using the ws:// protocol in the URL.  Any request query parameters can still be sent on the URL and the request body can be sent as one or more message from the client (as documented).  The end-point response will be sent as one or more response messages as documented (sometimes describing progress as with SSE end-points).

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)  WEB SOCKETS NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports WebSockets)\" to indicate that they can invoked via the Web Sockets protocol. This support is activated by invoking the end-point using the ws:// protocol in the URL.  Any request query parameters can still be sent on the URL and the request body can be sent as one or more message from the client (as documented).  The end-point response will be sent as one or more response messages as documented (sometimes describing progress as with SSE end-points).

Advanced attribute types usually require the user to have some knowledge of how the data is mapped in the entity repository (e.g.: \"RECORD_ID\" or \"DATA_SOURCE\").  An application may exclude displaying these as options if these things are being auto-generated or automatically selected for the user.  You may want to contact Senzing support before leveraging advanced attribute types in your application.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n

It describes the REST interface to Senzing API functions available via REST.  It leverages the Senzing native API which is documented at https://docs.senzing.com.  SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.  This support is activated by adding the Accept: text/event-stream header to a request to override the default application/json media type.  Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema. Upon success, the final event will be completed with the same response schema as a 200 response.  Upon failure, the final event will be failed with same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)  WEB SOCKETS NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports WebSockets)\" to indicate that they can invoked via the Web Sockets protocol. This support is activated by invoking the end-point using the ws:// protocol in the URL.  Any request query parameters can still be sent on the URL and the request body can be sent as one or more message from the client (as documented).  The end-point response will be sent as one or more response messages as documented (sometimes describing progress as with SSE end-points).  Upon failure responses will follow the same schema as the 4xx or 5xx response (typically the SzErrorResponse)\nOpenAPI spec version: 3.0.0\nNOTE: This class is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git\nDo not edit the class manually.\n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                        \"ADDRESS\" | \"CHARACTERISTIC\" | \"IDENTIFIER\" | \"NAME\" | \"OBSERVATION\" | \"PHONE\" | \"RELATIONSHIP\" | \"OTHER\"\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n    projects/rest-api-client-ng/src/lib/model/szAttributeNecessity.ts\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    SzAttributeNecessity\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Senzing REST API\nThis is the Senzing REST API.

SSE NOTE: Some end-points described here will indicate \"(Supports SSE)\" to indicate that they support \"Server-sent Events\" via the text/event-stream media type.

Further, the end-point will behave similarly to its standard operation but will produce progress events at regular intervals that are equivalent to its 200 response schema.
